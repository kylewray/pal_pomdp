# pal_pomdp
A POMDP model which solves proactive learning -- a generalized realistic active learning scenario with multiple, imprecise, irresponsive, cost-varying oracles. This source code implements the original three algorithms (PAL #1-3) proposed by Donmez and Carbonell, as well as our POMDP proactive learner. It also contains code to run experiments on the UCI Adult and Spambase datasets, with five different types of oracle scenarios (Original #1-3 and Complex #1-2).
